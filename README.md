# Machine-learning

To complement my Artificial Intelligence course at University, I wanted to gain some practical experience in using machine learning techniques. I implemented algorithms such as K-Means clustering, support vector machine and linear regression for classification along with using machine learning modules. I have also taken an advanced machine learning course covering Bayesian inference, Bayesian networks, HMMs and Gaussian Processes.
